# Dependency-Injection
This repository is the sample of the article [Dependency Injection — the first steps](https://medium.com/@billytagzz/dependency-injection-the-first-steps-988b83796647)

## What is Dependency-Injection
Dependency injection is the way to implement the [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) principle, the basic idea is decoupling our classes by using interfaces. “The high-level classes should not know about the low-level classes instead of it. They just should know about the interfaces that the low-level classes implements.”
